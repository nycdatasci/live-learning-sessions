## Choosing an Effective Visualization

The intent of a visualization is to effectively communicate relevant information in an easy to interpret manner for the audience, and supplements the other forms of communication.
To choose an effective visualization you need to keep in mind the **question or business problem** you are addressing, the **relevant information** that you generate to answer that question, and your **target audience**.

- A good visualization should establish two aspects of the data being presented:
1) Effectively communicate relevant information: The visualization is easily interpretable and shares information (metrics/values/trends) in a way that is important for the specific domain objective.
2) For the audience: The choice of how to create the visualization keeps in mind the audience and which information you are trying to share with that audience.

- The slides also include other tips for choosing an effective visual and improving its appearance.
