    "Thank you for joining this **NYC Data Science Academy** live learning session! Today we will be discussing different ways you can format and structure your Python code so that it aligns with common **best coding practices**. Using these best practices is very important because your code will be more interpretable by others (and yourself). Colleagues will consider you a more suitable team member which will aid in collaboration within a company and on team projects. The importance of this cannot be overstated. Follow the best practices we discuss today so that you are a more attractive candidate or colleague in the industry!"

    "## Why Write Interpretable Code?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key strengths of a programming language such as Python is how it can be used in a **collaborative** way. This is most obviously evident when we import modules and packages to use in our own work. Even when we write code that we don't intend to be used by others, we don't want to write it just for our \"current\" selves. We want to make sure that we will be able to easily pick up where we left off when we use the code in the future. Uniformly adhering to **good coding practices** will also help your syntax stay consitent no matter what or who your code is intended for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, once said that \"**code is read much more often than it is written**.\" It is important to keep this in mind when we design our code because the success of your work may rely on how easily someone else can read and use it, not on how cleverly or efficiently it accomplishes the intended purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help Python coders maintain a unviersal standard of coding convention, van Rossum and a few other Python experts developed a series of documents called the **Python Enhancement Proposals**, or **PEPs**, which cover a range of different topics including Python development, backwards compatibility, style, and debugging. One of the most well-known PEPs is the **PEP8 Style Guide for Python Code**."

    "## Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Although naming convention isn't specifically addressed in Peters' collection of aphorisms, this is an important topic that is under the umbrella of a number of the key ideas above. There are a myriad of ways to name objects in Python, but **some ways are definitely better than others**. Some common paradigms are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `x`: single lowercase\n",
    "- `X`: single uppercase\n",
    "- `lowercase`\n",
    "- `lower_case_with_underscores`\n",
    "- `UPPERCASE`\n",
    "- `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`\n",
    "- `CapitalizedWords`: also known as CamelCase\n",
    "- `mixedCase`: first word lower case, following words upper case\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the options above, there are other naming conventions in Python that have special meanings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `_single_leading_underscore`: weak \"internal use\" indicator, e.g. `from module import *` does not import objects whose names start with an underscore.\n",
    "- `single_trailing_underscore_`: used by convention to avoid conflicts with Python keywords.\n",
    "- `__double_leading_underscore`: when naming a class attribute, invokes name mangling (inside class `FooBar`, `__boo` becomes `_FooBar__boo`).\n",
    "- `__double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__`: \"magic\" objects or attributes that live in user-controlled namespaces, e.g. `__init__`, `__add__`, or `__str__`. These are also called \"special name methods.\" Never invent such names; only use them as documented.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You should **avoid using Python keywords and built-in function/class names as variables names**. Names such as `max`, `sum`, `class`, `list`, and others should be avoided. When these names must be used, end the name with a **single underscore** to differentiate it, such as `list_`."

When you work on these problems, try to solve them on your own first. If after a few tries you can't come up with a solution or your solution only passes the first few test cases, check the **discussion board** for that problem. You can find solutions from other coders, and users on the site can upvote more popular answers. Reading these popular solutions helps immensely to **increase your coding maturity**.

A full table of operator precedence can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence) (the table starts with least priority and goes to highest priority). As we can see in the table, the `not` operator is **higher priority** than the `or` operator.

If we evaluate the expression `ary < 6`, a **boolean array** is returned where each value indicates whether that element in the original array is less than 6. This is called **broadcasting**, where we apply an operation to each individual array element, and this is a very useful property of numpy arrays! However, if we try to evaluate the absolute truth value of the boolean array we get an error. This is because the array as a whole cannot be determined to be `True` or `False` without some additional work. The array class in numpy has some methods we can use to **aggregate the values** to a single truth value, namely the `any()` and `all()` methods."
