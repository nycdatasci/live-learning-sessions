### Readability Counts: Best Practices in Python Coding

- As programmers, we try to write elegant code. This is for the benefit of those who may read and use our code in the future, including ourselves. As the PEP8 guide states, one of the key insights from Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, is that "code is read much more often than it is written." Readability is one of the most important qualities of beautiful code. 
- Join us to discuss popular Python coding conventions, and learn how to incorporate them into your own work to increase the readability of your code. This session will cover styles that will help you write code in a way that is more conducive to collaboration which will make you more attractive as a candidate or colleague in the industry.
