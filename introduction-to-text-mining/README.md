<hr> 

- In this session, we will examine methods of how one can analyze text data without delving into more advanced NLP methods. Students will find how using basic string methods, one can gleam relevant insight from review data to allow further conventional EDA methods

**Prerequisites:**

`pip install nltk`

Once installed, you can run in either Python or a Jupyter notebook:
```
import nltk
nltk.download('all')
```
