    "\n",
    "Here we would like to show you the fastest way we know to host a database, create tables you need, and start tackling your SQL questions. We will still use Docker but we are going to pull the <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql\" target=\"_blank\">official images</a>. The documentations on their web page shows you a variety of functionalities they provide us, including change the configurations and upload old SQL data. It's nice to read through them but today we only need the simplest Docker command:\n",

    "- the name of the container.\n",
    "- the password for root.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name allows you to find the container easily, you don't need to always refer to the container id if you have given a name to the container. The password is for security reason so if you don't allow connections from outside of your computer - that means if you don't change the default configuration - it's really not important. A simple password is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing you might need to pay more attention to is the port number because we need it for the connection from MySQLWorkbench. On the left hand side of the argument `-p`, most people would just use 3306 which is the same as the right hand side. In case your 3306 is allocated alreay, you need to try another port. If you have a local MySQL 5.x on you native system then you very likely need to use a port other than 3306. Try to start a container with the simple command below (if you don't insist to use your own name and password.) If you don't see any error message than you are fine:\n",

    "### Some Examples of Window Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Often the way a window function works is very similar to `GROUP BY`. The main difference is that it doesn't collapse the a group to a single row. To understand it's application, consider the example below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Date_reported  | Country_code  | Cumulative_cases\n",
    "-------------- | ------------- | -----------------\n",
    "2020-02-29     |   CA |  18\n",
    "2020-03-01     |   CA |  23\n",
    "2020-03-02     |   CA |  31\n",
    "2020-01-30     |   US |  10\n",
    "2020-01-31     |   US |  11\n",
    "2020-02-01     |   US |  12\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider if we want to know the new cases everyda, pretending that we don't have it in this table, often we want to create a new column by shifting the Cumulative_cases to get:\n",
    "\n",
    "Date_reported  | Country_code  | Cumulative_cases  | Cumulative_cases_prev_day\n",
    "-------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |-----------------\n",
    "2020-02-29     |   CA |  18 | NA\n",
    "2020-03-01     |   CA |  23 | 18\n",
    "2020-03-02     |   CA |  31 | 23\n",
    "2020-01-30     |   US |  10 | NA\n",
    "2020-01-31     |   US |  11 | 10\n",
    "2020-02-01     |   US |  12 | 11\n",
    "\n",
    "So that the differences between the two columns would be the number of new cases. However, shifting directly  will not result in a table above, insead it would be like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Date_reported  | Country_code  | Cumulative_cases  | Cumulative_cases_prev_day\n",
    "-------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |-----------------\n",
    "2020-02-29     |   CA |  18 | NA\n",
    "2020-03-01     |   CA |  23 | 18\n",
    "2020-03-02     |   CA |  31 | 23\n",
    "2020-01-30     |   US |  10 | 31\n",
    "2020-01-31     |   US |  11 | 10\n",
    "2020-02-01     |   US |  12 | 11\n",
    "\n",
    "and 10 - 31 makes no sense! This motivates a genearl idea of window function - shifting needs to be done within each group/country!\n",
    "\n",
    "So the syntax for that is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT Date_reported, Country_code, Country, New_cases,Cumulative_cases,\n",
    "\tLAG(Cumulative_cases) OVER (PARTITION BY Country_code ORDER BY Date_reported) AS cases_yesterday\n",
    "FROM who_data;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark**: Here we see that window function won't collapse the observations of the same country into a single row as `GROUP BY`. A sensitive audience might notice that not only to prevent mixing data from different countries when shifting, `ORDER BY` also relies on partitioning. All details aside, often to come up with a right query we need to think about whether the output should be a single row or as many rows as in the original table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now consider the opposite example, from daily new cases to cumulative cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Date_reported  | Country_code  | New_cases\n",
    "-------------- | ------------- | -----------------\n",
    "2020-02-29     |   CA |  0\n",
    "2020-03-01     |   CA |  5\n",
    "2020-03-02     |   CA |  8\n",
    "2020-01-30     |   US |  1\n",
    "2020-01-31     |   US |  1\n",
    "2020-02-01     |   US |  1\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we need to sum up the rows but return a number for each row, that's again a window function case! The query is like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "\tDate_reported, Country_code, Cumulative_cases,\n",
    "    SUM(New_Cases) OVER (PARTITION BY Country_code ORDER BY Date_reported) AS derived_cumsum,\n",
