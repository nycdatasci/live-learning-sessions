### A/B Testing for Data Science (with Python and R)

This Live Learning Lesson is an introduction to A/B Testing.

In this session you will learn:
- What is an A/B Test and why/when it's used?
- Examples of A/B Tests.
- How is an A/B Test done?
  - The A/B Testing process is broken down into individual steps and illustrated in interactive diagrams.
- The fundamental concepts behind A/B testing, such as hypothesis testing, significance level, and p-value.
- What is a Permutation Test and why/when it's used?
- How to use a Permutation Test to do the hypothesis testing part of an A/B test.
  - The Permutation Test process is broken down into individual steps and illustrated in interactive diagrams.

The second part of this session shows how to code the learned concepts (from scratch), using both Python and R. The session ends with a demonstration of an R Shiny App that summarizes the whole process of A/B Testing with Permutation Test.

There are no prerequisites to attend this session.

Summary of the files associated with this session:
- `presentation.html`: the presentation (slides)
- `presentation.Rmd`: R markdown that creates the presentation
- `figures`: folder containing all the figures used in the presentation
- `functions.R`: R script with helper functions used both in the presentation and in the R Shiny App.
- `app.R`: R script to create the R Shiny App (slide 25 of the presentation contains instructions on how to launch this R Shiny App, using RStudio).
