#Two different problems arise:
#- Splitting our data into chunks of 4 because of the first row of our dataset;
#  what about when we have transactions with more than 4 items?
#- Creating features that not only include the items that were purchased,
#  but also the artificial order in which they were purchased. Technically,
#  there is no order to a basket of items, just whether or not the items were
#  included in the transaction.

#Instead, let's create a sparse matrix. The different items will represent the
#columns and the rows will represent the transactions; essentially we are
#creating an indicator variable for each available item. The resulting matrices
#will be quite large; under the hood, the sparse matrix that we are creating
#using the read.transactions() function is only actually storing the 1's among
#the millions of cells.

#Load the Association Rules library and store the groceries data in a sparse
#matrix.
